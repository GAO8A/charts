# `ibm-design-data-vis`

## Design

The project currently leverages [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/) in order to manage multiple packages contained within this project. To learn more about this, please view our [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Examples

At the moment, we only have `./examples` to show what our desired output is. This page uses inaccessible work and is only examples instead of reusable pieces. To run:

1. `git clone https://github.com/IBM-Design/data-vis.git`
2. `cd data-vis`
3. `yarn install`
4. `npm run examples`
